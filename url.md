# Operating Systems Resources

I've linked some stuff in this page that might be useful for you, future readers. Do try them!

## Before You Start

You need to know bash and C! If you have no idea what either of them are, I highly recommend to do your homework on them first!
Here are some basic links to get you started!
Also, you should have access to a terminal somewhere, installing WSL or using the git terminal is good enough for windows user.

### Bash

## Credit Where Credit's Due

[Rahmat Mustafa Samik Ibrahim](https://www.cs.ui.ac.id/index.php/rahmat-mustafa-samik-ibrahim/), also known as RMS, is (or was) my lecturer for this course. He worked on a lot of the resources I shared. I'd like to thank his hard work, for without it, I may or may not have been here.
