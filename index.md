# Operating Systems

Welcome to my Operating Systems page! I'm Nadhif Adyatma Prayoga, also known as ([eaglescommander](https://github.com/eaglescommander/)).
I'm a student of University of Indonesia, majoring in Computer Science.
This page is part of my journey through the course OS201

## The Why

This page is created to complete the first task that I was given for my finals. While this page only serves as an introduction of me, you might find the other page I create (link down below) more interesting as it contains a few links that will lead you to resources of what the course entails. Enjoy!
